# ResultRecorder
A student management system to analyze and store the results and  marks of students in a class or school.

Implemented Using PHP, HTML and MySQL.
This application program is useful to learn database connectivity and querying using PHP and HTML.
I have used mysqli_connect() for databse connectivity.


Steps to run the application

1. Install XAMPP
2. Go the location where XAMPP is installed( Probably in,  Eg: Local Disk(C:))
3. Open folder named XAMPP
4. Open folder named htdocs and create a folder "asd" ( if you want to give other names change the location details from all the php codes accordingly)
5. Store or download the contents from the github repository folder "htdocs" to the folder asd (created in step 4)

6. Run the XAMPP application( Double click on XAMPP Icon)
7. From the opened window start Apache and MySQL
8. When both are running click on Admin button of MySQL, A webpage will be opened
9. Click on the "New" option to create new database (Probably on left side)
10. Click on import
11. Upload the file db.sql from the github repository folder database to XAMPP using choose file option( Download the file first)
12. Click Go
13.The database named "result_recorder" would be imported to the Xampp Server

14. Now go to the Xampp folder and then to htdocs
15. There would be a file named Result_Recorder.html, Open the file in any browser

16.Now you can select the options and navigate through the applications ( Admin or teacher username and passwords can be found in the imported databse in Xampp server page )
17. Whenever you make a new entry it would be updated in the result_recorder databse in Xampp server
